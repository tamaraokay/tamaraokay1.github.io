<p>Talofa lava, Kia ora, Malo lelei and Welcome to my website that is All About Me. My name is Tamara Okay, I am 15 years of age and attend Tamaki College. I was born and raised in Australia, then moved to Samoa in 2007 then made the final move to NZ in 2008. My parents are both Samoan so that makes me full blooded Samoan, I have 4 brothers and 5 sisters, including the step siblings. I am very out going and fun to hang with, I have 3 best friends and a average amount of friends...i think. My favorite hobbies are playing sports/watching them too, hanging out with friends and spending quality time with my family. I am interested in the IT industry because I think that their isn't that much islander's nor girls involve in  the Industry. </p>
